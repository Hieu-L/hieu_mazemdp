# Hieu's MazeMDP

This is a custom library taken from Mr. Olivier Sigaud's SimpleMazeMDP library, with modifications to remove the "well" state. 

I've been using this custom library to work on my research project on Priotized Replay algorithms, to create a discrete maze environment as well as an agent to navigate it.
